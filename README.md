# Game-Kickstart

To create your game follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo
2. Edit setup.sh file and replace 'Jut'/'JUT'/'jut' with the name of your game. Then run the setup.sh file.
   This will rename all file names and file contents.
3. Write Engine first (and use game-kit-tests to test for serialization and other obvious errors)
4. Write UI
   4.1. To test UI, you need to clone the SuperApp repo
   4.2. And place this repo inside the lib/ directory
   4.3. Then ask @bpanthi977 to create app interface for your game
   4.4. Write you UI
5. Done!
